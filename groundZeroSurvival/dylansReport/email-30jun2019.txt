Hi Paul,

That's no problem. Thank you both for collecting the data. I did most
of the distance analysis with some R functions that I wrote. It's
super easy to do it over again. I'll post the script on my github once
it's a little more polished up.

Attached is the new distance matrix and some graphs.

Analysis

I did a logistic regression on the data and found that the distance
between a fern and the nearest tree or log had a significant effect on
survival (z = 1.979, p = 0.0479). But just barely! It's a weak
relationship and it only stands if all the ferns are included. If the
data are standardized to only include ferns within 15 ft of a tree or
log, the relationship disappears. If logs are removed from the data,
the relationship disappears. I think this strongly suggests that in a
die-off zone, there is a distance threshold beyond which ferns are
almost incapable of surviving. However, below that threshold,
proximity to trees and CWD has little to no effect on survival.

The survival rate was 10.2% for sword ferns within 15 ft of a tree or
log. In contrast, the survival rate was 2.3% for sword ferns further
than 15 ft from a tree or log. That may not sound like a big
difference but the odds of a fern surviving are 4.8 times greater if
it is located within 15 ft of a tree or log.

The species and DBH of the nearest tree had no significant effect on
survival. Likewise, there is no effect of DBH or minimum distance on
the total number of fronds, nor the ratio of new fronds to old fronds.

Minor formatting changes
- I renamed smaller.doug.fir as smaller.doug.fir.log (just wanted to make it clear in the name that it was a log)
- I  changed 'species' of sw.tree.07 to 'CWD' (I read in the comments
  that this is a stump so it made sense to me  to change it to coarse woody debris)

Column Names
status = whether fern is alive or dead
fronds.new = number of new fronds
fronds.old = number of old fronds
fronds.ratio = ratio of new to old fronds
min = minimum distance to the nearest tree (or cwd)
species = species of tree or 'cwd' if it's a log or stump
dbh = diameter at breast height (trees) or mean diameter (cwd)
